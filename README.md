# Pixel Run
Developed a 2-D pixelated shooter game, using python and pygame. 

Some of the main concepts I learned and applied were:

- Variables, Loops, Arrays, Classes, Modules
- Implemented input tracing bullets using **Object Oriented Programming**, and trigonometric calculations from the Python Math library. 
- Added enemy tracing bullets to increase the difficulty of the game.
